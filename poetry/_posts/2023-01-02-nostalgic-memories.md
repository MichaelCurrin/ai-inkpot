title: Nostalgic memories

```
Nostalgic memories, once so sweet
Bring a pain that cuts so deep
Reminders of a life once lived
And moments that can never be relived

The laughter and the tears we shed
The people and the places now dead
A ghost of what was once our own
But now just a memory, alone

We try to hold on to what's left
But time and fate can be so deft
Eroding even our fondest past
Leaving nothing but a pain that lasts

We try to find some sort of peace
But the pain just will not cease
It lingers on, a constant ache
A reminder of what we can never take back.

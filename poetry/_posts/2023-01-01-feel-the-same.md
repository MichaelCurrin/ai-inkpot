title:  Tell me if you feel the same as I do
---

```
The feeling that consumes me
Is one that I can't shake
It courses through my veins
And makes my heart ache

I think of you constantly
And wonder what you're thinking
Do you feel the same as I do
Or am I just sinking?

I try to push the thought away
But it always comes back
This feeling of longing
That I can't seem to hack

I want to be with you
And hold you in my arms
But the thought of rejection
Keeps me from taking the charm

So here I sit and wonder
If you feel the same
This constant ache and longing
For a love that's untamed.

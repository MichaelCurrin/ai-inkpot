title: Mist
---

```
The mist rolls in, a ghostly shroud
That wraps the world in a cocoon.
It blurs the lines and softens the edges,
A canvas upon which our imaginations can scrawl.

In the mist, we are all equal,
Our movements slowed and our senses dulled.
We become one with the fog,
Lost in a dreamlike state, untethered from the world we know.

But in the mist, there is also beauty,
A sense of peace and serenity.
We are free from the distractions of the world,
Able to embrace the present moment and all its mysteries.

So let us embrace the mist,
And allow it to envelop us whole.
For in its embrace, we may find
A sense of wonder and magic, and a connection to something greater than ourselves.

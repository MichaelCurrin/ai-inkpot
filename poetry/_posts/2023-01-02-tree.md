title: Tree

A tree stands tall and proud,
A symbol of strength and life.
It reaches for the sky,
A beacon in the midst of strife.

Its leaves rustle in the breeze,
A gentle reminder of the passage of time.
It stands steadfast and unyielding,
A source of shelter and peace of mind.

It is a part of the natural world,
A reminder of the beauty that surrounds us.
It stands tall and strong,
A testament to the wonders of nature.

title: Brighter future
---

```
The past is gone, a fading dream
But now it's time to chase a new theme
A brighter future lies ahead
With opportunities to be seized, not fled

We cannot change what's been and done
But we can shape what is to come
So let us cast aside our fear
And embrace the future, clear and near

The road ahead may have its twists
But we will face it with persistence
And though we may stumble and fall
We will rise up and give it our all

For the future is ours to mold
And the possibilities, endless and untold
So let us embrace it with open hearts
And move forward, towards a brighter start.
```

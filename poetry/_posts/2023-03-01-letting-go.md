title: Letting go
---

```
Happiness is a delicate thing,
A butterfly that flutters on a breeze,
But if we hold it with too tight a grip,
It slips away with ease.

We search for it in money, fame,
Success and all things grand,
But happiness is not found in things,
But in the love we understand.

To be happy, we must first accept,
All that life has in store,
And let go of the need for control,
And expectations that we bore.

We cannot cling to what we have,
Or yearn for what we lack,
For happiness is a state of mind,
That requires no attachment's track.

Love and acceptance are the keys,
To unlock the door of our heart,
To let happiness come and go,
Without tearing us apart.

So let us cherish what we have,
And love with all our might,
For happiness is not a thing to keep,
But a feeling to hold in sight.

title: School of love
---

```
In the school of love,
we learn and grow,
our hearts and minds
unfold and show.

In this sacred space,
we give and take,
our souls and spirits
awaken and shake.

We discover new ways
to express and share,
our feelings and emotions
that once were bare.

In the school of love,
we find our way,
to happiness and joy
at the end of each day.

With open arms,
we embrace the light,
and with each passing moment
our love grows bright.

So let us learn,
and let us grow,
in the school of love,
where hearts and souls
unite and flow.

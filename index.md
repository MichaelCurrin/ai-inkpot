Welcome to my blog of content inspired by AI. I cover topics like poetry, lyrics, useful tips for life, and coding.

The content on this site is mostly generated by AI. I usually edit the content - for flow, style, taking out unnecessary parts or combining the best parts. So it is not simply copied. Sometimes I show the prompt I used or at least a bit of the prompt from that conversation.

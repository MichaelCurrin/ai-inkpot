Frisian is a West Germanic language spoken in the Netherlands, Germany, and Denmark. It is the native language of the Frisian people and is closely related to English and Dutch.

Frisian has three main dialects: West Frisian, spoken in the Dutch province of Friesland; North Frisian, spoken in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein; and Saterland Frisian, spoken in a small area in Lower Saxony, Germany.

Here are the phonetic transcriptions of the Frisian phrases I provided earlier, using the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA):

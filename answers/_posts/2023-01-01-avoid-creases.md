prompt: advice for how to avoid creases in shirts

Here are a few tips to help avoid creases in your shirts:

- Before hanging your shirt, lay it flat on a table or other smooth surface. Smooth out any wrinkles and make sure it is evenly distributed.
- Use hangers that are the right size and shape for your shirts. Avoid using hangers that are too small or too large, as they can cause the fabric to bunch up and create creases.
- When hanging your shirt, make sure it is evenly spaced on the hanger and that the shoulders are supported. Avoid hanging your shirt by just the collar, as this can cause the fabric to stretch and create creases.
- Store your shirts in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. Sunlight can cause the fabric to fade and become brittle, which can lead to creases.
- If your shirt does become creased, try steaming or ironing it to remove the wrinkles. Always follow the care instructions on the shirt to avoid damaging the fabric.

By following these tips, you can help prevent creases in your shirts and keep them looking crisp and clean.
